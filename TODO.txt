Bug fixes:
--> Auto-merge doesn't detect bots that pass over each other
--> If you can't leave a tile that has destructible wall on it, you're trapped.
--> Destructible walls move the maze a pixel or two.

Features:
--> "Luck" upgrade
--> Points for clearing destructible walls

Balancing:
--> Calculate totals

Maze Generation:
--> Find unique maze designs for different maze regions/biomes.

Stats Tracker
--> Total tiles visited
--> Total tiles revisited
--> Total points
--> Total mazes completed
--> Total points from maze completions

Refactor:
- Maze should have its own class
- RNG bots should have independent movement speed
- Custom coloring based on regions
- Absolute imports only!!!
